The **panas-go** library exposes utility data and functions to help with the community sentiment analysis, based on the paper [PANAS-t: A Pychometric Scale for Measuring Sentiments on Twitter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1857).

The library exposes `sentiment` package for **data** and **computation functions** that are described in the PANAS-t paper.

It is expected that you study the paper before using this library. Once you have gone through the paper, using the library will be straight-forward.
